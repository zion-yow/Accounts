# I hope to develop a tool to help me to do persenal accounting staff monthly, which works without any human involes.
- Fortunately, Alipay and Wechatpay provide persenal bills for users, and for most of chinese people, that would be the main way they pay with(which is unfortunate).

- Most annoying part of accounting staff should be classifying all of the bills, however we could make it a NLP problems for ChatGPT to dealwith.
# First part of the tool is getting our bill automatedlly.
- The difficulty would be the lack of python API support for these pay platform.
- Authenticity and Safety should be priorities. 
# NLP and Simple Analysis with ChatGPT's help
- I categorize my income and expenditure items into: essential food intake, non-essential food intake, transportation, processed durable goods, electronic durable goods, subscription-based audiovisual entertainment and leisure, offline entertainment and leisure.
- I need the AI help classify my every pay by reading the detailed information of the bill, like Stores' name, Location, the products/services name, Date and Amount, etc.
